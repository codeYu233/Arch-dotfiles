## Installation
Just clone the repository,overwrite the .config folder with the config in this repo. 

## What apps do you need?
- JaKooLit's Hyprland
- zsh
- nvim
- neovide
- lunarvim
- yazi
- fcitx5、rime
- neofetch
- autojump

## What's in the repo?
The dotfiles support Chinese input method(based on fcitx5、rime).I've changed some colors and added some scripts to make it more convenient to use.

## How to make it looks like mine?
1. Use the wallpaper in the `wallpapers` folder.
2. Choose the "Rose Pine" theme for waybar
3. Use the "Peony" layout for waybar
4. Use the zsh、oh-my-zsh、nvim-lunarvim

## Tips
Don't like my settings?
You can change the hyprland into any theme you like,just change these files. : )

The dotfiles use the fcitx5+rime as the input method to support the Chinese.
If you don't need them,just don't install them and delete the config files.

## Todo
- Permanently solve the problem that the Chinese input method can't be used in some apps,such as Chrome、vscode...
- Add more scripts to make it more convenient to use.
- Make a install.sh
